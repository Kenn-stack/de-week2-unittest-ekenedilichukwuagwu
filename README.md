# 🩸 Artificial Pancreas System (APS)

A **simplified data-driven model** for glucose regulation — simulating how an artificial pancreas might respond to meals, exercise, and glucose fluctuations.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Models **glucose dynamics** in response to meals and exercise.
* Automatically decides whether to:

  * Deliver insulin
  * Warn for low glucose
  * Maintain current state
* Validates inputs with clear **type** and **value checks**.
* Tracks **total insulin delivered** across sessions.
